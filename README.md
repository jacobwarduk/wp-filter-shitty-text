WordPress plugin which filters out 'shitty text' such as emojis when copy/pasted from Twitter, which can 'break' your WordPress post.


Description
-----------

When copying and pasting text from external sources into the WordPress post input, often there will be 'shitty text' characters due to emojis and the like. This can break your post or cut it off at that point. The WP Filter Shitty Text plugin removes these characters to ensure your copy/pasted text does not break your post.
