wp-filter-shitty-text
=====================

WordPress plugin to filter 'shitty text' input and prevent cutting or breaking of posts.


Description
-----------

When copying and pasting text from external sources such as Twitter into the WordPress post input, often there will be 'shitty text' characters due to emojis and the like. This can break your post or cut it off at that point. The WP Filter Shitty Text plugin removes these characters to ensure your copy/pasted text does not break your post.
